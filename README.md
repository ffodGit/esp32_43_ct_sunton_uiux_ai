This is a tutorial on how AI can assist embedded systems developers in creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing UI/UX designs. As embedded systems developers, we often focus on hardware, firmware, and/or software development, but a well-crafted UI/UX design is essential to delivering a complete and intuitive user experience for projects requiring a graphical user interface. In this video, we’ll dive into how AI can ease the process, allowing developers to focus on what they do best.

This tutorial builds upon an existing “Getting-Started” guide for rapid GUI development on a 4.3-inch capacitive-touch ESP32 display using LVGL, EEZ Studio, and Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO. The original tutorial produced a multi-screen application featuring various interactive widgets, including buttons, bars, arcs, labels, a text area, and a keyboard. These widgets interact with the serial port and external components like LEDs, a buzzer, and a potentiometer. In this tutorial, we’ll take that base application and enhance its user interface with the help of Claude AI. The YouTube and GitHub repository links for the original tutorial are provided in the description below.

We’ll be working with the 4.3-inch capacitive touch ESP32 display module from Sunton, an affordable option featuring an 800x480 pixel IPS RGB display and a USB Type-C programming interface. This module also includes a micro-SD card slot for additional storage, along with 1.0mm-pitched and 1.25mm-pitched ports that expose power, serial port, and several GPIO pins. With minimal code adjustments, the demonstrations in this tutorial can also be adapted for use with other ESP32-based display modules, such as the CrowPanel displays from Elecrow and the gen4-ESP32 series from 4D Systems.
Let's get started!
